# Tombs of Amascut Invocation GUI

Graphical user interface built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) to simulate [Old School RuneScape's](https://oldschool.runescape.com/a=97/) [Tombs of Amascut's](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tombs_of_Amascut) invocation system. 

### TODO

- Add sound effects for turning invocations on and off
- Add images to each invocation for easier category identification
- Add ability to save presets
- Show a rewards window corresponding to the rare drops that players could receive at that raid level
- Have a section that shows the description of the invocation that was last toggled (instead of an on hover event)
- Prevent user from breaking invocation rules (like having two "Attempts" category invocations active at the same time)
